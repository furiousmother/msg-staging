          I remember saying to myself, “Is this even real?” The theatrical sense of light and unapologetically bold colors are what drew me into Bao Ngo’s work when I first came across it three years ago. Her aesthetics have evolved since the Flickr days, yet the playful and performative quality of her work is still intact. Whether in vast landscapes or in obscure motels, it is easy to enter the worlds she’s creating — that’s the beauty of Bao’s work.  Dialing in on a convergence of rich colors, costume styling, and dramatic storytelling, Bao creates images that are ethereal yet familiar, transporting me to nostalgic landscapes.
        </p>
        <p class="question-2">
          On a Sunday afternoon we sat down with Bao in her sun filled bedroom in Brooklyn decorated with eclectic vintage furniture and a cart with a few of her beloved digicams. The four of us sat cross-legged on floor of her bedroom. In the comfortable and intimate setting Bao spoke openly and extensively about her experiences growing up in Texas, her family, and how her upbringing influences her photography practice. Though I was nervous at first about photographing Bao, she had this down-to-earth demeanor that created a open and collaborative dialogue. As we moved around different corners of her room, with her cat in and out of frames, it was clear to me that she is comfortable in her own skin and is grounded in her identity. Bao’s humility does not disservice the confidence of her work, but strengthens it.

          He was interested in photography, so he is one of those assholes who kind of bought a dslr and was like, yeah, I'm a photographer now. He never really pursued it. I think he loved it and did it for fun. He is more into like collecting art and art dealership. I mean he's a farmer now, so total career change.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lived in a house in suburban Minnesota. We had a huge basement and our entire basement was just filled with my dad's art. He put his ceramics and vases in big glass cases and then he installed fancy gallery lights in our basement and essentially built a gallery in our basement. He used to go to auctions in Europe– he has a lot of friends who work for like Christie's and Sotheby's. I wouldn't say he’s a fine artist, but he’s very interested in curation and dealership. And he picked up photography just as a hobby.

          Yeah, there was definitely backlash. When I was in high school, I interned for a lawyer for two years and actually she loved me. She always told me like, you know, if you decide to do this with your life, I'll pay for your grad school. You just come back and work for me. I really thought I was going to be a lawyer, but a friend of mine who was going to Pratt at the time said if I applied to Pratt I’d get in. And I did.

        <p style="display:block;">
          My mom’s a Vietnamese folk singer and so she's an artist herself. And I think no matter what her kids do, she's going to be happy if they do something. But my dad was like, no, absolutely not. But I guess he realized I wasn't going to change my mind because I never really listened to him anyway. Before I moved here to start going to Pratt– he told me I don't care what you do as long as you do it well. And I was like, okay, that's fair. I can try that.

          Well, so he came to the states from Vietnam, when he was around sixteen. Then he went to university in Maryland and got his degree. They both went to university and got bachelor's degrees here. His was in mathematics and his first job out of university was for an architecture firm. So actually, like, he got a math degree and then kind of went down the design route for a little bit. But then he got into the corporate world and I think, you know, that's why he worked in the corporate world for so long that he was like, my kids are going to do the same. And he was very strict when I was growing up. He was like, you need perfect grades, you need perfect everything.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          I think the reason why he softened up so quickly about the whole art school situation was he realized he couldn't fight me. We're both really stubborn. If he chose to fight me then, you know, I had no problem with cutting him off because I wasn't asking my parents for money. I just wanted them to be there emotionally.

      <div class="answer">

          Actually, there wasn't much culture shock. I felt like I was very culture shocked my entire eight years of living in Texas, and so when I came here I was kind of like, yeah, this is where I should have been the whole time. But in Texas I grew up in a very conservative, very white area. I always argued with kids, I was always picking fights with people in my classes. No one liked me, so when I came here and I had friends, I was like, this is comfortable. Immediately I felt comfortable here. No culture shock.

          It's definitely positive.

I pick and choose the good things and I don't forget the bad things, but you know, I can choose to draw inspiration from the good things and despite growing up in an area where I definitely didn't get along with most people, I definitely have a lot of good memories there.

I'm not sitting next to this girl. It wasn’t even directed at me. It was just because she said this and nobody reacted. And the kid who she directed it towards was silent. I mean, what was he going to say? I don't know. I walked out and skipped class.

          I will never know what it's like to be black and being called the n-word specifically. But I was definitely called a lot of things. There were actually a lot of Asian kids at my school and even they looked down on me because I was more of a creative person. I wasn't seen as like smart. Whereas the rest of them were very much like, look at my grades and then they would like compare papers to see who got a higher score. I'm not very competitive and while I did make good grades, I stayed out of that competition because it was definitely an expectation and it was forced on me mostly by other Asians. I mean white people would say things, but it was also a lot of Asians would say things to me and I was like, you don't need to talk to me like this. I want you all to succeed.

           It's cool that you support other minorities because I feel like a lot of times Asians are like considered to be the token minority, and as a result a lot of them kind of take a passive stance when they witness racial injustice. On your Instagram you’re very outspoken about these issues and I think that's really awesome. Were you always that way?

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          I'm not expecting seventh graders to have like a moral compass– but like, back then I totally thought it was normal for people to be racist, for people to be homophobic or whatever. I didn't think about anything because it's the environment I grew up in. But when I got to high school, I went to an international school for the first two years and most of the kids weren't even American, English wasn't even their first language. think that exposed me to a lot of different kinds of people. Around this time I was also coming to terms with being queer. Then I started becoming really outspoken when I transferred to a public school and saw all this behavior that would not have been accepted at my previous school.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          Asians are the model minority, they are very passive in general and don't speak out about things that affect other people. Or they care about like, Asian men in Hollywood need to be considered fuckable by white people. And I'm like, this is, there's so much horrible shit happening. Like Southeast Asians have some of the highest poverty rates in all of America. And we are here worried about whether the male lead from Crazy Rich Asians is considered fuckable by white people.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          I try to think about like, diaspora in very broad terms. Like there are tons of us all over the world. It's not just Asian Americans and what we experience here. I don't think there is really such thing as ‘the collective Asian American experience’, but I think a lot of people experience a lot of different things and I think it's important to talk about them.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          I'm actually not sure about that one because there are so many different ethnicities and so many different countries and also like the issue of like what is Asia. Like um, like for example, I have a friend who's from Kazakhstan and people say she's Asian American and when actually she speaks Russian and doesn't identify with any sort of Asian culture. And then in America they would say like, oh, Kazakhstan is West Asia, but then if you ask her, she's like, I'm not Asian. I think there are a lot of issues with just labeling people.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          So all of that is very complicated. When we get boxed into stereotypes, East Asians are seen as very nerdy, studious, dorky, geeky. I think Southeast Asians are definitely seen as like Asian gangsters, like very troubled. These are unfair generalizations obviously. But even if we are any of those things, it’s okay. It’s ok to be who we are, whether or not that does or doesn’t fit a stereotype. We’re all complex individuals. We can be smart and still troubled, we can be happy but still critical. It doesn’t have to be one or the other.

          Most of it’s been client work, and in that case, I'll work with the client and really make sure that they are portrayed the way they want to be portrayed and I really asked them about their vision. So if someone's hired me, I really want to make sure that what they want is prioritized over what I want. If it's like a collaboration with friends, I definitely try to, even if it's my idea, make them as comfortable as possible. I think photography has a lot of issues with like exploitation and surveillance. A lot of photographers don't ask models like, hey, is this okay or is it alright to portray you this way? Or have you posed this way?
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          It's this power dynamic where the photographer definitely has much more power, so I try to be very conscious of the way I work with people. Photography, definitely to me, relies on exploitation to thrive a lot of the time. I think people talk about like male-photographer-female-model, they'll talk about that power dynamic. But they don't talk about how inherently there's the power dynamic in which the photographer’s always in power.

          Basically I will take most clients who come to me. I would say about fifty percent of the work that I put out online is client work. The other half is like personal and for my personal work I like to work with friends. It's always people I already know or people I have mutual friends with. I don't really contact people I don't know.

          You say you work with friends, but they're also like, well established models or YouTube personalities. How did you meet them?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          It's all through the Internet. So I meet a lot of my collaborators on Instagram or Twitter, but it doesn't start out like I follow them because I want to work with them or I reached out to them because I want to work with them. It's just I liked their work, I respect their work, I like what they're doing and maybe eventually that turns into working together. So usually I'll meet someone online and then it takes like several months of us being friends online and then we meet and maybe we work together, maybe we don't.

          How did your project with Mitski and her latest album happen?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          I met her a couple of years ago when she was still playing really small venues around Brooklyn. First time I shot her was maybe four years ago. Almost a year ago, I DM’ed her on Instagram to have a reunion and collab again and instead, she was like, Actually, would you be down to do my album artwork and press photos for my new album that isn’t coming out til next year?
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          So it wasn't like someone who is as well known as her just like randomly reached out to me. We've had an established connection for a couple of years and it started with like both of us being very local artists on the Internet.

          I don't think anything's overrated. What's underrated? I feel like Banh Xeo is very underrated. It's a nice cute dish, like a crepe kind of. I can never find it anywhere, but I always want it.

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Yeah, it’s pretty good. But it was like so impossible to find three years ago when I was trying to find it, but I feel like if more people tried it they would love it.

          Well, it's also hard to make pho, and hard to make, like, most Vietnamese foods.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          Another thing I've noticed, culturally, it is very common to give massages by walking on people's backs. I definitely want that to be a real thing. I want to be able to walk into a massage parlor and say walk on my back. That's underrated. Yeah. It needs to happen.

          Favorite Asian, if any?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          My sister. She's 19, lives in Texas and works at a fast food restaurant. She's like an Instagram baddie. She's a ceramic artist who sold her first piece when she was 15. It was a vase she made that sold for around $1,000 and she just graduated from high school a couple months ago. She's my hero because she's doing everything that I tried to do, except she's doing an in Texas instead of New York. To me there's definitely resilience to that. I respect her a lot.

          Yeah. No. She doesn't have her artwork on it, but if you want to admire her beauty, her Instagram is @tuhan.ngo. I will not be dropping my brother’s Soundcloud link, unfortunately for him! I think he also is like retired, which is really funny.

          He did retire before a tattoo. He doesn't have any really. None that I know of, surprisingly.
