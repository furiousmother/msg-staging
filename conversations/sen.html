      <div class="question">
        <p>
          There’s a quality in Sen’s music you only understand as “this is some high-level shit” and can’t quite put into words. The vague discomfort in listening to many of the songs doesn’t come from being perplexed by something obscure or experimental, but rather from trying to process its complexity and sophistication. I found myself wanting to listen to the album over and over again, consequently familiarizing myself with the grounded, well-informed songwriting, getting more out of it each time. The jazz melodies, weird time signatures and lush layering gives his music a stickiness that isn’t the same kind of stickiness in pop music, but is more rewarding. For weeks I’d been solely listening to Sen’s Cannonball! and the preceeding record, It’s Late, thinking “this guy is so cool, he is so good at what he does but also doesn’t give a fuck!”
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          So when we heard back from Sen Morimoto back in September agreeing to do this interview, Kevin and I were so psyched we discussed flying to Chicago over a weekend to meet with him. When we told Sen our plan, he responded, to everyone’s benefit, that he’d be in New York the first week of October playing part of a tour he’d be on with 88Rising.

          That was the first time my mom saw me, yeah. She was here the day before the show and um, well she's seen me play other stuff, but like this is the first time it's my music. My dad, I flew him out for the shows in Japan and that was the first time he’d seen that.

          How much of that taps into your work, if at all?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Yeah, it definitely does. I think um, it's hard to tell. Like there are moments where it feels very deliberate and it can feel really good if you know exactly what you're doing with it and can communicate properly the idea of Asian-ness or like something that is uniquely Asian for Asian people to relate to on purpose. Instrumentally, it's not a ton. I grew up listening to mostly American music. But just in terms of like content of lyrics, there are times when I realize just the manner in which I'm talking about a certain situation is like very Japanese. It's funny to me like, that’s how a Japanese person awkwardly handles love or something. You know what I mean?
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          And it's not just my Asianness. My Americanness affects it too. So I think it's easier to count the times that it's very deliberate, and those times also are a little harder to put out into the world because you feel like you're not speaking for people but hoping to connect with people and you hope that it translates.

          You're also in a unique position in that your cultural background is mixed. Growing up, did you identify with one more than the other?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          It’s funny, I was the only Asian kid around ever. I grew up in like a really small town in Massachusetts and you know, you’re like someone's ‘Asians friend.’ That was a term I’d thought about a lot as a kid. But starting from when I was six, I would go back to Japan once a year or once every two years and every time I was there I was like, oh my God, I'm so embarrassingly American, this is so brutal.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          So, it's a little bit of both, it just depends on where you are. I guess what's funny about it is the feeling that connects you to that culture a lot of times is when you feel like, not embarrassed but like, you’re sticking out like a sore thumb. The different-ness is what makes you feel that way. I went to a Japanese language school on Saturdays growing up, and like there I was very American too, you know, they were like, this kid cannot speak Japanese.

          Do you ever have to run it by your parents to get it evaluated?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          I’m way too ashamed of my Japanese to do that. I have been asking my brother for help translating interview stuff recently, which has been fun. There's just little things that make me feel like I'm back in Japanese school, like doing homework, or my dad would help me read Kanji and stuff like that. But writing-wise, I feel like it would be bad to write things in Japanese that I didn't understand myself naturally. It would just be fake and weird. So even if it's wrong, I think it's kind of better. And I know there are parts that are wrong. There are also parts that I write and I realized they’re wrong and I'll keep it wrong because that's how it happened and it's got to stay that way.

          So you feel more like an outsider when you go to Asia versus like your experience growing up Asian in a white community?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          It’s different because in Japan it feels like I'm letting someone down, not because anyone like wants you to feel that way, but maybe that's something to do their culture. It's like you know, you should have it in you to do better. Whereas in America it's more just like, Weird! His family like doesn't eat burgers. I went to their house and we had rice. My Dad was always like, white people get energy from bread, we get energy from rice.

        <p>
           Yeah. Growing up, there's like so many of these normalities that you don't realize is a solely Asian thing until you go to college and have roommates. Like one thing that I frequently get surprised at is like my mom's always used the dishwasher as a drying rack and I'm like, wait, you can use the dishwasher for its intended purpose.

          Not a ton. I only lived there briefly as a baby and then just intervals, like a month at a time there like once a year or something.

           In ‘People Watching’ you mention watching anime with someone. What are some of your favorites?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          I'm trying to catch up with Attack on Titan right now. It's pretty sweet. I think that is a nice modern anime. It's very much for the modern attention span. It's not like Dragon Ball where it’s all dragged out screaming.
        </p>
        <p style="display:block;">
          A lot of how I learned how to read Japanese was actually Dragon Ball. I was hooked on Dragon Ball comics. We’d ask my aunt in Japan over the phone to send us manga. So actually my parents' house, there's a shelf, it's like a whole wall with manga. Hunter Hunter is one of my favorites. I like some of the funny ones too, like Pyu to Fuku! Jaguar. It’s about this guy, Jaguar, who plays a recorder. That’s the whole premise. Like literally nothing happens. They just do battle of the bands.
